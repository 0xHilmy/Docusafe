# Docusafe
DocuSafe is a secure, no-code Solana app that allows users to register and verify important document metadata on-chain. The app stores cryptographic hashes (not the actual file), ensuring user privacy while enabling proof of existence, authenticity, and timestamp. Wallet connection required. All data is immutably tied to the userâ€™s address.
